- **FIR-Filter**: Implements FIR filtering techniques, including added window functions.
- **basic-test-signals**: Scripts and examples for generating and analyzing basic test signals used in DSP.
- **circular-convolution-using-linear**: Demonstrates how to perform circular convolution using linear convolution methods.
- **circular-convolution**: Contains examples of circular convolution.
- **dft**: Implements discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and its properties.
- **idft_code**: Contains code for inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT).
- **linear-convolution-using-circular**: Demonstrates how to perform linear convolution using circular convolution methods.
- **linear-convolution**: Contains examples of linear convolution.
- **overlap-add-save**: Demonstrates the overlap-add and overlap-save methods for convolution.
