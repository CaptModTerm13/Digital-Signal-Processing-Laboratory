# Sine Wave Generation using DSP Kit

## Aim
To generate a sine wave using a DSP Kit.

## Theory
A sine wave is a smooth, periodic waveform with a gradual change in amplitude over time. The amplitude of a sine wave varies from a starting point of 0, reaches a maximum value of 1 at 90째, a minimum value of -1 at 270째, and returns to 0 at 360째. This periodic cycle repeats every 360째 (or \(2\pi\)), giving the sine wave its smooth and continuous characteristics. Sinusoidal signals are fundamental in various applications due to their predictable behavior and smooth transitions.

## Procedure

1. **Set Up Project in Code Composer Studio (CCS)**
   - Open Code Composer Studio (CCS).
   - Go to **File** > **New** > **CCS Project**.
   - Select the target as **C674X Floating Point DSP, TMS320C6748**, and the connection as **Texas Instruments XDS 100v2 USB Debug Probe**. Verify the settings.
   - Name your project and click **Finish**.

2. **Code the Sine Wave Program**
   - Write the program to generate a sine wave.
   - Save the program as `main.c` by going to **File** > **Save As** and providing a filename.
   - Delete any pre-existing `main.c` file to avoid conflicts.

3. **Debug and Run the Program**
   - Select **Debug** to compile and upload the program to the DSP kit.
   - After debugging, choose the **Run** option to execute the program.

4. **Set Up Graph in CCS**
   - Open the **Tools** menu and go to **Graphs** > **Single Time**.
   - Set the **DSP Data Type** to **32-bit Floating Point** and **Time Display Unit** to **seconds**.
   - Use the name of the array from your program (e.g., `s`) as the **Start Address**.

5. **Run and Visualize**
   - Click **OK** to apply the graph settings.
   - Run the program or click **Resume** in CCS to visualize the sine wave.

## Results
Following this procedure, you should see a sine wave graph generated by the DSP kit.
